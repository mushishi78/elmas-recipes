    ½ tsp black pepper
    1½ tsp paprika
  </ingredients>
  <ingredients title="Tahini Sauce">
    1 garlic clove, pressed
    1 tbsp lemon juice (½ lemon)
    3 tbsp tahini
    1 tbsp water (plus more as req)
    ½ tsp salt (to taste)
    ¼ tsp black pepper (to taste)
  </ingredients>
  <ingredients title="Garnish">
    2 tbsp pomegranate  molasses

    1 tbsp parsley leaves, finely chopped

  </ingredients>
  <method>
    <step>
      <b>To make roasted cauliflower</b>: Preheat oven to 220oC
    </step>
    <step>
      In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower florets with the olive oil,
      paprika, salt and pepper until evenly coated
    </step>
    <step>
      Transfer cauliflower onto a large baking sheet and spread around in a
      single layer (avoid crowding as humidity will cause sogginess)
    </step>
    <step>
      Roast until crispy and golden brown, about 45 minutes, stirring halfway
      through cooking. Remove cauliflower from the oven and transfer to a
      serving platter and let cool
    </step>
    <step>
      <b>To make the tahini sauce</b>:  In a small bowl, combine the garlic,
      tahini and lemon juice. The sauce will thicken at this point so water
      will need to be added. Start with one tablespoon and mix well until it
      gets a yoghurt consistency. Add more water to achieve the right
      consistency. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Set aside.
    </step>
    <step>
      When the roasted cauliflower has cooled, sprinkle with the tahini sauce,
      lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, chopped mint and
      parsley leaves. Serve immediately.
    </step>
