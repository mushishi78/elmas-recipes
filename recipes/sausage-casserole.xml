    <step>
      Preheat oven to 180o (Gas Mark 4)
    </step>
    <step>
      Cook vegan sausages as per package instructions (while they are cooking,
      you can prep your ingredients)
    </step>
    <step>
      Heat the oil in the casserole pan (pressure cooker), add diced onion and
      fry over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes, until soft and golden
    </step>
    <step>
      Add the garlic, carrots, kale, fresh and canned tomatoes and tomato
      puree, vegetable stock, paprika and rosemary and stir all the ingredients
      together well. Cut the cooked sausages into bite-sized pieces and add
      these to the casserole too.

      Place the lid on the casserole and transfer to the oven (put lid on

      return to heat. Cook for a further 15 minutes until everything is cooked
      through and smells amazing!
