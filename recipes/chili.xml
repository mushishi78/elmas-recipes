  <ingredients>
    2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
    1 medium red onion, chopped
    1 large red bell pepper, chopped
    2 medium carrots, chopped
    2 stalks celery, chopped
    ½ tsp salt, divided into two ¼ tsp
    4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
    1 tbsp chili powder
    2 tsp ground cumin
    1½ tsp smoked paprika
    1 tsp dried oregano
    800g chopped tomatoes
    800g black beans, rinsed and drained
    400g pinto beans, rinsed and drained
    2 cups vegetable broth or water
    1 bay leaf
    1-2 tsp lime juice, to taste
    Garnishes: sliced avocado, tortilla chips, grated cheddar cheese etc.
  </ingredients>
  <method>
    <step>
      In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until
      shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot, celery and
      ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally,
      until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 7 to
      10 minutes.
    </step>
    <step>
      Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook
      until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.
    </step>
    <step>
      Add the chopped tomatoes and their juices, the drained black beans and
      pinto beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the
      mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and
      reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 30 minutes.
    </step>
    <step>
      Remove the chili from the heat and discard the bay leaf. For the best
      texture and flavour, transfer 1 ½ cups of the chili to a blender, making
      sure to get some of the liquid portion. Securely fasten the lid and blend
      until smooth (watch out for hot steam), then pour the blended mixture back
      into the pot. (Or, you can blend the chili briefly with an immersion
      blender, or mash the chili with a potato masher until it reaches a
      thicker, more chili-like consistency.)
    </step>
    <step>
      Mix in the vinegar, to taste. Add salt to taste also.
    </step>
    <step>
      Serve with garnishes of your choice. This chili will keep well in the
      refrigerator for about 4 days or you can freeze it for longer-term
      storage.
