    12 tbsp vegetable oil
    2 onions, sliced
    2 garlic cloves, crushed
    4 tbsp tomato puree
    Splash of soy sauce
    400mL Madeira or fortified wine
    400mL vegetable stock
    4 tbsp barley
    2 tsp dried thyme

    <step>
      Heat the vegetable oil and fry the onion and garlic until soft. Stir in
      the tomato purée and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the soy sauce,
      Madeira and stock and bring to the boil, then add the barley. Reduce
      the heat, cover and cook for 25 minutes, or until the barley is soft.
    </step>
    <step>
      Peel and chop the parsnips, carrots and celery sticks attractively, then
      cook them in the stock for about 10 minutes until just tender. Par-boil
      the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water.
    </step>
    <step>
      Stir the thyme into the sauce and season to taste. Layer all of the
      vegetables, except for the potatoes, in six individual pie dishes and
      spoon over the sauce.
    </step>
    <step>
      Toss the potatoes in olive oil and season well, then layer these on top
      of the vegetables. Place the dishes under a preheated hot grill until
      the potato topping looks golden and crispy
