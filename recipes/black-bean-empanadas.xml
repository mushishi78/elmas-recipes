  <ingredients title="Empanada Dough">
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1 cup wholewheat flour
    ¼ cup semolina flour
    2 tbsp raw sugar
    1 tsp sea salt
    ½ tsp baking powder
    5 tbsp butter, cold
    ½ cup cold water
    2 tsp apple cider vinegar
  </ingredients>
  <ingredients title="Empanada Filling">
    Black beans
    Refried black beans
    Red bell pepper, diced
    Onion, diced
    Fresh cilantro
    Lime juice
    Spanish spice blend
  </ingredients>
  <ingredients title="Pico De Gallo">
    Fresh diced tomatoes
    Diced white onion
    Sea salt
    Lime juice
  </ingredients>
  <method>
    <step>
      <b>Make the filling</b>: Sauté onion, red pepper, and spices with the
      whole black beans.
    </step>
    <step>
      Mix in the refried beans. Warm and then remove from heat. Add lime juice
      to taste.
    </step>
    <step>
      <b>Make the dough and bake the empanadas</b>: Mix the first six
      ingredients together in a large bowl. Then add butter. Break up into
      small pieces by hand. When fully dispersed, the dough is ready for the
      water/vinegar solution. Mix this until you have a shaggy dough; it might
      require more water.
    </step>
    <step>
      When it sticks together, turn it out onto a floured board and roll into
      a 5x8-inch rectangle. Pop it back into the refrigerator at this time for
      an hour or so. This is an important step.
    </step>
    <step>
      When ready to make the empanadas, pull out of the fridge and roll it out
      a bit more to 9x12-inch.
    </step>
    <step>
      Cut it into 12 equal portions. Roll each square again to a 6x6-inch piece.
      These are your diamonds.
    </step>
    <step>
      Fill one with a tablespoon or two of filling. Arrange so a corner is facing
      you and flip one side over to form a triangle. Crimp the edges with your
      fingers or a fork.
    </step>
    <step>
      When they're all assembled, arrange on a lightly sprayed baking sheet and
      bake at 200°C for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.
    </step>
    <step>
      <b>Make the Pico De Gallo</b>: Mix together the diced tomatoes, white
      onion, lime juice, and sea salt
    </step>
  </method>
